=head1 NAME

StaticVolt - Static website generator

=head1 VERSION

version 1.00

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use StaticVolt;

    my $staticvolt = StaticVolt->new;  # Default configuration
    $staticvolt->compile;

=over

=item C<new>

Accepts an optional hash with the following parameters:

    # Override configuration (parameters set explicitly)
    my $staticvolt = StaticVolt->new(
        'includes'    => '_includes',
        'layouts'     => '_layouts',
        'source'      => '_source',
        'destination' => '_site',
    );

=over 4

=item * C<includes>

Specifies the directory in which to search for template files. By default, it
is set to C<_includes>.

=item * C<layouts>

Specifies the directory in which to search for layouts or wrappers. By default,
it is set to C<_layouts>.

=item * C<source>

Specifies the directory in which source files reside. Source files are files
which will be compiled to HTML if they have a registered convertor and a YAML
configuration in the beginning. By default, it is set to C<_source>.

=item * C<destination>

This directory will be created if it does not exist. Compiled and output files
are placed in this directory. By default, it is set to C<_site>.

=back

=item C<compile>

Each file in the L</C<source>> directory is checked to see if it has a
registered convertor as well as a YAML configuration at the beginning. All such
files are compiled considering the L</YAML Configuration Keys> and the compiled
output is placed in the L</C<destination>> directory. The rest of the files are
copied over to the L</C<destination>> without compiling.

=back

=head2 YAML Configuration Keys

L</YAML Configuration Keys> should be placed at the beginning of the file and
should be enclosed within a pair of C<--->.

Example of using a layout along with a custom key and compiling a markdown
L</C<source>> file:

L</layout> file - C<main.html>:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title></title>
        </head>
        <body>
            [% content %]
        </body>
    </html>

L</source> file - C<index.markdown>:

    ---
    layout: main.html
    drink : water
    ---
    Drink **plenty** of [% drink %].

L</destination> (output/compiled) file - C<index.html>:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title></title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <p>Drink <strong>plenty</strong> of water.</p>

        </body>
    </html>

=over 4

=item * C<layout>

Uses the corresponding layout or wrapper to wrap the compiled content. Note that
C<content> is a special variable used in C<L<Template Toolkit|Template>> along
with wrappers. This variable contains the processed wrapped content. In essence,
the output/compiled file will have the C<content> variable replaced with the
compiled L</C<source>> file.

=item * C<I<custom keys>>

These keys will be available for use in the same page as well as in the layout.
In the above example, C<drink> is a custom key.

=back

=head2 Pre-defined template variables

Some variables are automatically made available to the
templates. Apart from C<content> described elsewhere, these are all
prefixed C<sv_> to differentiate them from user variables.

=over

=item sv_rel_base

If the generated web-site is being used without a web-server (i.e. just
on the local file-system), or perhaps if it may be moved around in the
web-server hierarchy, then absolute URIs to shared resouces like CSS
or JS will not work.

Relative paths can be used in these situations.

C<sv-rel-base> provides a relative path from the source file being
processed to the top of the generated web-site. This means that layout
files can refer to shared files like CSS using the following in a
layout file:

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="[% sv_rel_base %]css/bootstrap.css" />

For top level source files, this expands to C<./>. For any
sub-directories, it expands to C<../>, C<../../> etc. Sub-directory
expansions always include the trailing slash.

=back

=head1 Walkthrough

Consider the source file C<index.markdown> which contains:

    ---
    layout : main.html
    title  : Just an example title
    heading: StaticVolt Example
    ---

    StaticVolt Example
    ==================

    This is an **example** page.

Let C<main.html> which is a wrapper or layout contain:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>[% title %]</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            [% content %]
        </body>
    </html>

During compilation, all variables defined as L</YAML Configuration Keys> at the
beginning of the file will be processed and be replaced by their values in the
output file C<index.html>. A registered convertor
(C<L<StaticVolt::Convertor::Markdown>>) is used to convert the markdown text to
HTML.

Compiled output file C<index.html> contains:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Just an example title</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>StaticVolt Example</h1>
            <p>This is an <strong>example</strong> page.</p>

        </body>
    </html>

=head1 Default Convertors

=head1 How to build a convertor?

The convertor should inherit from L<C<StaticVolt::Convertor>>. Define a
subroutine named C<L<StaticVolt::Convertor/convert>> that takes a single argument. This argument should
be converted to HTML and returned.

Register filename extensions by calling the C<register> method inherited from
L<C<StaticVolt::Convertor>>. C<register> accepts a list of filename extensions.

A convertor template that implements conversion from a hypothetical format
I<FooBar>:

    package StaticVolt::Convertor::FooBar;

    use strict;
    use warnings;

    use base qw( StaticVolt::Convertor );

    use Foo::Bar qw( foobar );

    sub convert {
        my $content = shift;
        return foobar $content;
    }

    # Handle files with the extensions:
    #   .foobar, .fb, .fbar, .foob
    __PACKAGE__->register(qw/ foobar fb fbar foob /);

=head1 Inspiration

L<StaticVolt> is inspired by Tom Preston-Werner's L<Jekyll|http://jekyllrb.com/>.

=head1 Success Stories

Charles Wimmer successfully uses StaticVolt to generate and maintain his
L<website|http://www.wimmer.net/>. He describes it in his
L<post|http://www.wimmer.net/sysadmin/2012/08/11/hosting-a-static-website-in-the-cloud/>.
